# GBM4SingleZoneMultiNodeSystems
 Utilizing Differential Evolution (DE) and Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) to fit Physics Informed ML models of Single-Zone Multi-Node Systems for Energy Flexibility Applications.

 This repository includes the code that is utilized in our paper called "Leveraging Grey Box Models for Enhanced Energy Flexibility in Centralized and Decentralized Single-Zone Multi-Node Systems."

 We are not able to publish the ecobee dataset of 1,000 houses mentioned in the analysis. However, the dataset is publicly available at https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1854924
